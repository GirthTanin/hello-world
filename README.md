# hello-world
This is my first repository
I am having to consider stepping away from a very successful massage practice.
I'm not getting any younger.
I feel like I have missed a lot of earlier oportunities in my life for deep fullfillment.
Mentors did not just pop up in my life like I imagined/needed/want.
